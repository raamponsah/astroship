In Next.js, caching can be categorized into several types, each serving a different purpose:\r\n\r\n- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**\r\n- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**\r\n- **Client-Side Caching**\r\n- **Server-Side Caching**\r\n\r\n### Static Site Generation (SSG)\r\n\r\nStatic Site Generation (SSG) is a method where pages are generated at build time. This means the HTML is pre-rendered and stored as static files, which can be served immediately when requested. SSG is ideal for pages that do not change often, as it allows for incredibly fast load times.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\r\n  // Fetch data at build time\r\n  const data = await fetchData();\r\n  \r\n  return {\r\n    props: { data },\r\n    revalidate: 60, // Revalidate every 60 seconds\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n";
